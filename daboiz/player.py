    Helper function to print a drawing of a hexagonal board's contents.
    Arguments:
    * `board_dict` -- dictionary with tuples for keys and anything printable
    for values. The tuple keys are interpreted as hexagonal coordinates (using
    the axial coordinate system outlined in the project specification) and the
    values are formatted as strings and placed in the drawing at the corres-
    ponding location (only the first 5 characters of each string are used, to
    keep the drawings small). Coordinates with missing values are left blank.
    Keyword arguments:
    * `message` -- an optional message to include on the first line of the
    drawing (above the board) -- default `""` (resulting in a blank message).
    * `debug` -- for a larger board drawing that includes the coordinates
    inside each hex, set this to `True` -- default `False`.
    * Or, any other keyword arguments! They will be forwarded to `print()`.
