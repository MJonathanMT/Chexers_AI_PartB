# AI_proj_B

Second part of the project for Artificial Intelligence subject in the University of Melbourne.

## Overview

Utilized Greedy Search as the game playing agent for a 3-person adversarial game. Attempted implementation of Monte Carlo Tree Search in place of Greedy Search.

## Main learnings

### Object-Oriented Python

- Applied object-oriented concepts in Python. As a result, code is more organized and readable.

### Modularizing Python code

- Learnt the basics of modularizing Python code and packages. Main modules include:
  - _Player module_: Classes that define the game-playing agent and its 'artificial intelligence'.
  - _Referee module_: Classes provided to us that run the game with 3 player classes as inputs.
  - _Tests module_: Classes that test a few of the Monte Carlo Tree Search functions

### Writing Python tests

- I developed the Monte Carlo Tree Search Algorithm in a Test-Driven Development (TDD) way, to make sure every unit works as expected before proceeding to implement more complicated functions.
- While there are only a few test cases, this has allowed me to learn the basics of writing tests (specifically in Python), and I have begun to understand how important tests are in develepment.
